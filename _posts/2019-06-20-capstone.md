My capstone project was about predicting the daily bike usage demand. I have seen many bikes just piled away on the streets of Sydney as well as bike sharing companies not surviving due to lack of profits. So the aim of this project was to help these companies or any startups by identifying and correcting under supply or over supply of bikes, which will reduce cost and increase revenue. Because of time constraints, I was only required to develop a model that looked at supply for an entire city, but I would like to take it to the next level and show over supply and under supply at specific locations within a city.
